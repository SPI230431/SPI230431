In groups, opportunities for Continuous Professional Development (CPD) are mentioned. Each opportunity is to be rated on a scale of High, Medium or Low. These opportunities are designed keeping in mind how important these efforts are to data scientists in their personal development journey.

Opportunity 1: A data scientist trying to learn web development

• Significance level: Medium to Low

• Reason: Web development is an important skill, but not a core job for data scientists. Data scientists' core tasks include data analysis, algorithm development, and machine learning modeling. However, if data scientists plan to extend their studies to include integration into web-based models or create dashboards, it can be valuable to them.

• Something to look out for: Many data scientists work with software engineers or web developers to deploy their models to production, if their future plan is to be a part of this kind of teamwork, it can be helpful for them to learn this.

Opportunity 2: A data scientist looking to learn PyTorch to become a machine learning engineer

• Significance level: High

• Reason: PyTorch is a very popular deep learning framework, widely used by machine learning engineers and the scientific world. So, if a data scientist is looking to hone his skills to become a machine learning engineer, this skill is a great weapon for him.

• Point to see: Modeling is, and learning PyTorch can be helpful in this. Along with this, it will also help in understanding the analysis, deep learning and real-world applications.

Opportunity 3: A data scientist applying for a master's degree in finance

• Importance level: Medium

• Why: A master's degree in finance can prove beneficial for those looking to go into the finance or investment fields specifically. In data science, there are also many opportunities in the field of finance, such as in quantitative analysis or fintech industries.

• Point to watch: If a data scientist obtains a finance degree, he or she can embark on a new journey, particularly in the finance sector, expanding their roles and responsibilities into new markets. This is very important for them in the competitive field

Computing professionals must uphold integrity, responsibility and accountability while representing their profession. The following two scenarios are analyzed:

Scenario 1: A data science team contracts with a client for a software project, but does not complete the project on time.

• Ethical issue: The team head did not fulfill the promised time. It shows a lack of professional accountability and tiswas.

Solution: The team should have informed the client ahead of time on the topic why the delivery time is getting difficult. With this, trust is maintained with the client and ethics are maintained.

• Discussion: If the team had been honest with the client about the reason for the delay, they could have avoided breaking the lines of trust. Advance warning, support, and accountability should be a priority for every team, as deviating from these ethical standards damages trust and client relationships.

Scenario 2: An AI team receives data from two different clients and trains both to the same model without telling them.

• Ethical Issue: This is a huge ethical and legal dilemma, as the team trained the clients' data without obtaining their consent. This is a violation of data privacy.

• Solution: The team should have obtained clear consent from both clients and informed clients of the full situation of how to use their datasets cleanly and ethically
Discussion: In this scenario the team of clients

Collected their data without consent and trained a single model. This falls into a serious ethical quandary as standards of data privacy and accountability are violated. Integrity is very important to computing professionals, and using any data without consent shows a lack of trust.

When data is linked or used, clients must have full information and consent. In this incident, the team showed a lack of transparency and transparency, which calls into question their credibility. Keeping ethical principles in mind, the team needed to adhere to a process of clarity and consensus from the outset. This is not only necessary to protect privacy, but also to build a positive and friendly relationship with Delhi.
